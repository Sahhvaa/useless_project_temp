### Project Description
Have you ever wondered how it feels to get stuck into a loop? Well we introduce you the Infinite Maze which will help you to get tired physically and mentally.
A maze with no end,no escape and absolutely no reason to exist-perfectly useless,endlessly confusing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People walk through mazes way too quickly.They find the exit,feel proud,and go home.THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.What we really need is a maze with no escape,so people can get lost forever.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Infinite Maze.A maze that never ends,by design.Perfect for wasting time,confusing your friends or rethinking your life choices.
